And one of the best things abouts computer lab is that there is an A.C. in each and every computer lab. And the teacher tells us to make some shapes in M.S. paint its a lot of fun. And in this computer lab there is a projecter on a table (not included in the picture above) and sometimes in a free period they take us to a computer lab show us some children movies,and if the children make noises then the teacher gets irritated 😠then she takes us back to the classroom🤫.</p>

Sometimes the teacher tells us to play a specific game,in which you have to sit and there will be a person with a hankerchief who will throw it behind you and then you have to take the hankerchief and run behind the person who threw it behind you and catch him before he sits. That's no fun, none of the students like to play that game. And sometimes in our games period the teacher tells us to play freestyle, which is so much fun because we can play with any of our friends , which all the students love to do. And sometimes in the games period our P.T. teacher takes us to the basement where there are carrom boards and snakes and ladders boards or chess boards. And then sends the 60% of the children to play carrom, 20% of the children to play chess and 20% of the children to play snakes and ladders.Its a lot of fun.</p>

     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Each and every student loves the games period because we get to play with our friends after our studies. And sometimes when the games period starts and the games teacher is about to come then the children start talking loudly and when the teacher comes and she sees many of the students talking loudly she tells us that she will not take us to play games. That's the worst thing ever. And we only have our games period twice a week, so if on both the days teacher decides to not to take us to play that's really bad. I hate when that happens. And they should do a games period four times a week, physical activity comes prior to studies. And if the teacher decides to not to take us to play on both the days that's really irritating. Well, I bet no other school does it like they are not going to take the children to play. Afterall we are children and children have the right to play, even if we are making loud noises or troubling the teacher. Well, I really want my school to improve this habit, because I love the games period and even my friends love it a lot.</p>
